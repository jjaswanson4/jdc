# Configures foreman components.
# NOTE: Some foreman components can be mapped to katello components, such as operating systems and hostgroups. These should be run after the configure_katello role is run.
# By default, components with katello component mappings will not run by default. This behavior is controlled by the variable "requires_katello_content".
# There is also an overriding variable called override_run_all that can be used to run all tasks.
